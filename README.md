# pygwidgetsExamples
 A collection of programs that use the pygwidgets (and the pyghelpers) packages.
 
 Each of the programs in this collection assume that you have already installed both 
 pygwidgets and the pyhelpers packages.  If you have not installed them, then you
 must do that first before trying to run these programs. 
 
 To install these packages, you must bring up a command line (Windows) or the
 Terminal application (Mac) and run these commands:
 
 pip install pygwidgets
 pip install pyghelpers
 
 These commands will download these files and place them in the appropriate
 "site-packages" folder on your computer.
